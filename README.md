Flight Price Prediction Using Machine Learning Technique


This repository aims to address common challenges encountered in real-world data science projects by comprehensively covering each stage of the data science lifecycle. Below is a high-level overview of the lifecycle stages we focus on:

1. Data Collection
Gather relevant data from various sources to be used in the project.
2. Data Cleaning / Data Preparation / Data Pre-processing
Cleanse and preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for analysis, including handling missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conduct thorough exploration of the data to gain insights and identify patterns, relationships, and anomalies.
4. Feature Engineering
Enhance the dataset by creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
Feature Encoding
Outlier Detection and Imputation
Feature Selection or Importance Evaluation
5. Building Machine Learning Models
Develop machine learning models tailored to the project objectives using appropriate algorithms and techniques.
6. Automating ML Pipeline
Streamline and automate the process of training and deploying machine learning models to facilitate reproducibility and scalability.
7. Hyperparameter Tuning
Fine-tune the model parameters and configurations to optimize performance using techniques such as cross-validation.
By addressing these stages comprehensively, we aim to provide a holistic approach to data science projects, enabling users to effectively tackle real-world challenges and derive actionable insights from their data.
